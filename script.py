### üí° Welcome!

In the fast-paced world of technology, mental health often takes a backseat.  
This project aims to shine a light on the mental well-being of tech employees through data.

We‚Äôve built an end-to-end machine learning application that:
- Predicts whether an individual is likely to seek treatment
- Estimates the respondent‚Äôs age based on mental and workplace responses
- Groups users into similar mental health personas for personalized insights

### üìö Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project comes from a mental health survey conducted among technology workers globally.  
It includes questions on:
- Treatment history
- Workplace policies and support systems
- Personal and family mental health conditions
- Attitudes toward discussing mental health

We cleaned, processed, and modeled this data to build both a classification and regression system, along with clustering for deeper user understanding.

### üéØ Our Goal

To build a tool that can:
- Help organizations understand factors that affect employee mental health
- Provide insight into the kind of support employees might need
- Raise awareness and reduce stigma around mental health in tech workplaces

    ## üìà What does the data tell us?

    Understanding the structure and patterns in the dataset is a crucial first step before model building. 
    This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) section gives us an opportunity to:

    - Uncover trends and anomalies
    - Identify the distribution of key features like age, gender, and treatment status
    - Understand how workplace factors relate to mental health
    - Guide feature selection and model development

    ### üß† Mental Health in Tech: Initial Observations
    The dataset used in this project is based on a survey of tech employees around the world. It contains insights on:
    - Whether employees have sought mental health treatment
    - Workplace policies around mental health
    - Ease of access to mental health resources
    - Demographic features like age and gender

    Let‚Äôs walk through some key findings below.

    **Observation:**  
    We filtered the dataset to retain participants aged 18 to 65. Most respondents are in their 20s and 30s, with a sharp drop after age 40.  
    This age distribution is typical of the tech industry and impacts how we interpret mental health patterns in younger vs older employees.

    Individuals with a family history of mental illness are significantly more likely to seek treatment themselves.

### üî∏ **Cluster 1 ‚Äì Silent Sufferers**
- **Less likely to report available support at workplace**
- **May feel hesitant to disclose mental health issues**
- **Lower tendency to seek treatment**
- **Possibly facing stigma or organizational barriers**

This group may need **targeted outreach, policy changes, or culture shifts** to feel safer and more supported at work.

- Inform HR and policy changes
- Personalize mental health programs
